Questions to be done (28/02/2020)

1) Ramu wants to create a linked list to store the powers of 2
	i.e. 1->2->4->8->16 but, while creating the linked list Ramu mistakenly created
	the linked list as 1->2->8->16, i.e. he forgot to insert 4.
	Help Ramu rectify his mistake by adding 4 after 2
	*Remember you can't create new linked list, i.e. insert 4 after 2
	
	(Insert a node after a given node)
	
	
2) Repeat the same problem but with a different idea
	(Insert a node before a given idea, insert 4 before 8)
	

* Remember for both the questions, you will be given a linked list and the element to insert
Along with the element before or after which you have to insert

3) Given a linked list 1->2->3->4->5 and an element "4" , find the next and previous element
Make sure to make your program run for any linked list.
